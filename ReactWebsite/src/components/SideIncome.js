          <h1>Horticulture</h1>
          <p>
            Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce
            food and medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental
            purposes. Horticulturists grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables
            and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns. Historically, the
            study and practice of horticulture have been traced back to
            thousands of years ago; horticulture is known to have contributed to
            the transition from nomadic human communities to sedentary, or
            semi-sedentary, horticultural communities.Horticulture is divided
            into several categories which focus on the cultivation and
            processing of different types of plants and food items for specific
            purposes. In order to conserve the science of horticulture, multiple
            organizations worldwide educate, encourage, and promote the
            advancement of horticulture. Some notable horticulturists include
            Luca Ghini, Luther Burbank, and Tony Avent.<br></br>

          <h1>Animal Husbandry</h1>
          <p>
            Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals
            that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. It
            includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of
            livestock. Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic
            revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000
            BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. By the time of
            early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats and
            pigs were being raised on farms.<br></br>A large number of Indian
            farmers depend upon animal husbandry for their livelihood. Globally
            the scope of animal husbandry is quite good. Their are ample jobs in
            this field like supplying of meat, egg, milk, wool, etc. The animal
            husbandry plays a vital role in increasing Indian economy. Animal
            husbandry is the branch of agriculture science. Animal husbandry
            professionals can run their own farms.{' '}

          <h1>Bee keeping</h1>
          <p>
            Beekeeping (or apiculture) is the maintenance of bee colonies,
            commonly in man-made hives, by humans. Most such bees are honey bees
            in the genus Apis, but other honey-producing bees such as Melipona
            stingless bees are also kept. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees
            in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive
            produce (including beeswax, propolis, flower pollen, bee pollen, and
            royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to
            other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary
            or "bee yard".<br></br>India today has about eight lakh bee
            colonies. considering the modem beekeeping which arrived in India
            only three decades ago with the advent of the Khadi and Village
            Industries Commission (KVIC), today the number of bee colonies and
            beekeeper's co- operatives are 8, 10, 807 and 169 respectively. It
            has made a spectacular achievement. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal,
            Bihar, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Andaman
            and Nicobar islands are the important states in which beekeeping
            co-operatives are active.
