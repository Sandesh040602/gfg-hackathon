Agroboost is a comprehensive cross-platform app for farmers, offering assistance from sowing to harvesting. It uses ML tech for disease detection and crop recommendations. It provides real-time data on soil fertility, weather, weed risk, and air quality. Cost analysis and income source suggestions are included. Equipment trading is available, as well as a farmer community section with chat, video upload, Q&A, and more.
We have also deployed the project website on google cloud using AMD instance.

Some of its features are

1. Using ML technology for plant disease detection from image and recommending crops to grow based on farmer's location

2. Real-time information about soil fertility, weed risk, fire alert, weather forecast, and air quality to make the right farming decisions

3. Detailed cost analysis of growing crop explaining investment required and potential revenue generated along with suggesting other income sources

4. Option to buy/sell/rent farming equipment

5. Farmers' community section having chat option, video upload, QnA, and many more other features to make our platform interactive
